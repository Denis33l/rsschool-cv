I try to spend a lot of time in this game. Student life is really funny, because we have a lot of communication with new people. I Remember when we had summer exams we visited a white lake with my friends. In the university we learn programming and I liked this. But programmimg finished later and I need to   continue learning language programming. Recently I finished driving school and I got a drivers license. It was difficult for me, because I had a big temperature, but I my passed exam.
